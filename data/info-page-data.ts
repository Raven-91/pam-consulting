        </p>
        <h3>Grounds for data collection</h3>
        <p>
          Processing of your personal information (meaning, any data which may potentially allow your
          identification with reasonable means; hereinafter “Personal Information”) is necessary for the performance of
          our contractual obligations towards you and providing you with our services, to protect our legitimate
          interests
          and for compliance with legal and financial regulatory obligations to which we are subject. When you use our
          services, you consent to the collection, storage, use, disclosure and other uses of your Personal Information
          as
          described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we receive information about you?</h3>
        <p>We receive your Personal Information from various sources:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you voluntarily provide us with your personal details in order to create an inquiry (for
            example, your name and email address).
          </li>
          <li>
            From third-party providers and services, such as credit reference agencies, fraud prevention
            agencies, identity verification vendors, banks, authentication service providers and public registers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or engaging with 3rd parties in order to facilitate the Clients’ enquiry, which is already under
            contractual obligation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What type of information do we collect?</h3>

          </li>
          <li>
            Financial information – by its nature, your use of our services includes financial transactions, thus
            requiring us to obtain your financial details, which include, but are not limited to your payment
            details (such as bank account details and financial transactions performed through our services). This could
            be
            done before engaging with 3rd parties in order to facilitate a purchase or to prove that you have a
            sustainable
            amount of funds to support an extended visa, or for due diligence.
          </li>
